\section{Conclusions}
This project helped me to understand in \textit{deep} some of the simpler and most famouse \textbf{Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR)} shading techniques as well as implementing some new strategy to improve them. \newline
It also helped me to understand better the overall \textbf{rendering pipeline} and \textit{OpenGL} language. Even if I didn't implement everything introduced in \cite{referencePaper}, I tried to create a technique \textbf{closer to the original}, maintaining the same \textit{intent} of the authors, using local geometry to enhance shape depition of the testing 3D models. \newline
My implementation provides also a fairly high and stable frame-per-second (fps), making it possible to use the shader in \textit{interactive application} without any constraints on the choice of material or illumination model.
