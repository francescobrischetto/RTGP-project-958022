\subsection{Curvature Analysis}
Curvature analysis is another key point of the technique described in \cite{referencePaper}. \newline
However, curvature calculation was not so clear and straightforward in the paper because they introduced the \textbf{second fundamental tensor} and the computation of \textbf{Hessian of depth field} by differentiating the gradient with a \textit{Sobel filter}. \newline
The approach implemented in my project, instead, is simpler. It starts from here\footnote{\url{https://madebyevan.com/shaders/curvature/}} and considers \textbf{screen-space normals of neighbouring} fragments as well as \textbf{depth of the current fragment} to compute a curvature value.
\subsubsection{Screen Space Surface Curvature Implementation}
Surface curvature is computed in screen space, using OpenGL partial derivatives functions TODO.
