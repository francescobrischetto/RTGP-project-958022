This project report describes the realization and implementation decisions of the shading technique proposed in \cite{referencePaper}. \newline 
The paper's goal is to describe an approach for \textbf{enhancing shape depiction} of 3D objects on \textbf{Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR) shading models} using \textit{local geometry}. \newline
The approach described provides \textbf{time-efficiency}, to make it usable in \textit{interactive application}, without any constraints on the choice of material or illumination model. 
\newline The proposed method is inspired by \textbf{Normal Enhancement} and \textbf{Radiance Scaling} Shading approach and it tries to combine the advantages of both techniques while, also, relaxing their constraints. \newline
The overall goal of my project is to implement one of the newest techniques in NPR as well as coding some of the most famouse ones.
