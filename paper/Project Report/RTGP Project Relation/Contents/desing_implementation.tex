\section{Design and Implementation}
In this chapter I will cover all the implementation choices that I made during the realization of the project. Some of the operations described in the paper \cite{referencePaper} where not clearly specified so I was forced to take some implementation decisions and use the paper as a guideline. Moreover, some operations where too general and customizable so I tried to simplify it to make the project simpler. \newline
	Code-wise, My project started from the code version \textbf{lecture03a} that we saw during lectures.
