# Real-Time Graphics Programming

**OpenGL Project**

*Francesco Brischetto*

This project is based based on *"Geometry-based shading for shape depiction enhancement"* paper that can be found here:   
**https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313884131_Geometry-based_shading_for_shape_depiction_enhancement**

It applies a **Non-Photorealistic Rendering effect** to the illumination model that enhances object shape based on *object local geometry.*
